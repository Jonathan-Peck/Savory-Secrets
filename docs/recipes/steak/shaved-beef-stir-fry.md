## Ingredients
- 1 pound shaved beef
- 2 tablespoons tapioca starch, or arrowroot powder
- 2 tablespoons avocado oil, plus more as needed
- 2 cups broccoli florets, fresh or frozen
- 2 scallions, chopped
- sesame seeds for garnish
### For the stir fry sauce
- 1/2 cup coconut aminos, *see note for substitutions
- 3 tablespoons coconut sugar
- 1 teaspoon avocado oil
- 3 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon minced ginger

1. **Make the stir fry sauce**  
In a small sauce pot, heat the avocado oil with the garlic and ginger over medium heat. Let cook for a minute until fragrant. Add the coconut aminos and coconut sugar. Stir until the sugar is dissolved then cook on low for about 3 minutes until slightly reduced. Turn off heat.

2. **Prepare the beef**  
Place the shaved beef into a large bowl, separating the pieces one by one if necessary. Add tapioca starch and toss to combine using tongs so that each piece of beef is coated.

3. **Cook the beef**  
Pour avocado oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the shaved beef piece by piece in a single layer and cook until browned and crispy on each side. This will only take about 1 minute per side as the shaved beef is extremely thin. Work in batches until all the beef is browned. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

4. **Cook the broccoli**  
Leaving any residual oil in the pan, add the broccoli florets. Cook covered until tender.

5. **Combine and finish**  
Add the shaved beef back into the pan and pour the stir fry sauce on top. Stir to combine and coat the beef and broccoli in the sauce. Add the scallions. Cook for 1-2 minutes until sauce thickens and coats all the ingredients.

6. **Garnish and serve**  
Garnish with sesame seeds before serving.

:::tip

*You can substitute tamari or soy sauce for coconut aminos, but both are slightly saltier so you'll want to reduce the amount by about half
