## Ingredients
**Serves 4**
- 12 ounce beef flank steak, trimmed
- 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger or 1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger
- 1 1/2 teaspoons reduced sodium soy sauce
- 1 teaspoon dry sherry plus 1 tablespoon, divided in recipe
- 1 teaspoon cornstarch
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons oyster sauce
- 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
- 1 whole of bok choy, trimmed and cut into 2" pieces (about 8 cups)
- 3 tablespoons unsalted chicken broth

## Instructions 
1. **Prepare the Beef**  
Cut beef with the grain into 2" wide strips. Cut each strip across the grain into 1/4" thick slices. Combine the beef, ginger, soy sauce, 1 teaspoon sherry, and cornstarch in a medium bowl; stir until the cornstarch is no longer visible. Add sesame oil and stir until the beef is lightly coated.

2. **Make the Sauce**  
Combine oyster sauce and the remaining 1 tablespoon sherry in a small bowl. Set aside.

3. **Sear the Beef**  
Heat a wok over high heat until a drop of water vaporizes within 1 to 2 seconds of contact, add vegetable oil. Add the beef in an even layer; cook, undisturbed, until it begins to brown, about 1 minute. Using a metal spatula, stir-fry until lightly browned but not cooked through, 30 seconds to 1 minute more. Transfer to plate.

4. **Stir-Fry Bok Choy and Finish**  
Add bok choy and broth to the pan. Cover and cook until the bok choy greens are bright green and almost all the liquid has been absorbed, 1 to 2 minutes. Return the beef to the pan, add the reserved sauce, and stir-fry until the beef is just cooked through and the bok choy is tender-crisp, 30 seconds to 1 minute.
