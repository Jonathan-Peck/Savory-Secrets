<!-- truncate -->

## Ingredients
- 1 pound steak sirloin, new york strip, ribeye, etc, chopped into cubes
- 1 Tbsp avocado oil
- 2 tsp liquid aminos or soy sauce
- 1 tsp garlic powder
- ¼ tsp paprika
- ¼ tsp sea salt to taste
- ¼ tsp black pepper to taste

## Instructions 
1. **Preheat the Air Fryer**  
Preheat the air fryer at 400 degrees for 4 minutes.

2. **Season the Steak Bites**  
Add all of the ingredients to a mixing bowl and stir well until everything is coated in oil and seasoning.

3. **Arrange in Air Fryer Basket**  
Transfer the raw steak bites to the air fryer.

4. **Cook and Shake**  
Air fry 10 to 20 minutes or until steak reaches desired doneness, stopping twice throughout the air fry process to shake the drawer. I let mine go for about 12 to 15 minutes and they turn out perfectly tender and juicy.
