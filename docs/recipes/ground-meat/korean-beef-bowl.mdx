In a small bowl, whisk together brown sugar, soy sauce, sesame oil, red pepper flakes, and ginger.

3. **Cook the Meat**  
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet (a wok works well) over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add ground meat and cook until browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the meat as it cooks; drain excess fat if needed.

4. **Cook the Vegetables**  
Cook vegetables in a separate skillet.

5. **Combine and Simmer**  
Stir the soy sauce mixture and green onions (and vegetables if applicable) into the skillet with ground meat until well combined, allowing to simmer until heated through, about 2 minutes.

6. **Serve**  
Serve immediately.
