## Ingredients
**serves 8**
- 1 tablespoon canola oil
- 1 large onion, sliced
- 1 medium sweet red pepper, sliced
- 1 medium sweet yellow or orange pepper, sliced
- 1 cup dark beer

**Burger:**
- 1 lb ground beef
- 1 lb uncooked bratwurst link, casings removed
- 1 large egg, lightly beaten
- 1 tablespoon 2% milk
- 3/4 breadcrumbs
- choice of cheese slices (muenster cheer or pepperjack go well)

## Instructions 
:::danger[Grill]
if cooking on grill use a cast iron skillet

:::

1. **Cook the Vegetables**  
    In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Add onion and peppers; cook and stir 5 minutes. Stir in beer. Bring to a boil.  
    Reduce heat; simmer, uncovered, until vegetables are tender and liquid is almost evaporated, 15-20 minutes. Remove and keep warm.

2. **Prepare the Patties**  
    In a small bowl, combine beef and bratwurst, mixing lightly but thoroughly. Shape into 3/4" patties.

3. **Coat the Patties**  
    In a shallow bowl, mix egg and milk. Place breadcrumbs in a separate shallow bowl. Dip patties in egg mixture, then roll in crumb mixture to coat.

4. **Cook the Burgers**  
    In the same skillet over medium heat, cook burgers until a thermometer reads 160°F for medium doneness and juices run clean, 3-4 minutes on each side;  
    top with cheese during the last 1-2 minutes of cooking. Serve burgers on buns with mustard and onion mixture.
