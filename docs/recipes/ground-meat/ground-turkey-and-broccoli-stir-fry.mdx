## Ingredients
- 1 lb ground turkey
- 2 cups broccoli florets
- 1 cup carrots, sliced
- 1 cup mushrooms, sliced
- 3 teaspoon low sodium soy sauce
- 3 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon ginger, minced
- 1 onion, diced
- 3 tablespoons vegetable oil
- salt and pepper to taste

## Instructions 
1. **Marinate the Turkey** 
In a medium bowl, break up the ground turkey and add in the garlic, ginger, and soy sauce. Mix well and set aside to marinate while you prep the rest of the dish.

2. **Cook the Vegetables** 
Heat a large wok over high heat and add in 1 tablespoon of the vegetable oil. Once it's melted and the wok is very hot, add in the onion and stir-fry until soft, about 1-2 minutes. Add in the carrots, mushrooms, and broccoli and stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until the vegetables are tender-crisp. Remove the vegetables from the wok and set aside.

3. **Cook the Turkey** 
Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in the wok and add in the marinated ground turkey. Stir-fry until the turkey is cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.

4. **Combine and Finish** 
Add the vegetables back into the wok and pour in the worcestershire sauce. Stir-fry for another 1-2 minutes until everything is heated through and well combined. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

5. **Serve** 
Serve hot over rice or noodles, if desired.
