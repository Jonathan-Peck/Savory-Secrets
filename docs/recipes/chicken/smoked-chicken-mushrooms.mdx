## Ingredients

- 2 large boneless, skinless chicken breasts
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 teaspoon onion powder
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 8 oz (225g) cremini or button mushrooms, halved or thickly sliced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon fresh thyme (or 1 tsp dried)
- 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions

1. **Prep the Chicken and Mushrooms:**  
   Pat the chicken breasts dry. Rub with olive oil, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper.  
   In a bowl, toss the mushrooms with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt, pepper, and half the thyme.

2. **Preheat the Pellet Smoker:**  
   Set your pellet smoker to 225°F (107°C). Use a mild wood like hickory, pecan, or apple for best flavor.

3. **Smoke the Chicken and Mushrooms:**  
   Place the seasoned chicken breasts directly on the grill grates.  
   Arrange the mushrooms in a grill-safe pan or on a sheet of foil, and place them next to the chicken.  
   Close the lid and smoke for 45–60 minutes, or until the chicken reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Stir the mushrooms once or twice during smoking so they cook evenly and absorb smoke.

4. **Finish and Serve:**  
   Remove the chicken and mushrooms from the smoker. Let the chicken rest for 5 minutes, then slice.  
   Serve the smoked mushrooms over or alongside the chicken. Garnish with fresh parsley and the remaining thyme.

**Pellet Smoker Tips:**  
- Always preheat your smoker with the lid closed for 10–15 minutes before adding food.  
- Use a meat thermometer to ensure the chicken reaches a safe internal temperature.  
- For even more flavor, you can brine the chicken breasts for a few hours before seasoning and smoking.
