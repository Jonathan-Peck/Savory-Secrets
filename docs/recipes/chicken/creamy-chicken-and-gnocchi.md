## Ingredients
**Serves 3**
- 1 large chicken breast cut into 1/2" cubes
- 1 Tbsp Italian Seasoning
- 3 teaspoons smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 2 Tbsp cooking oil
- 1 medium yellow onion, diced 
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 Tbsp salted butter, divided
- 1 lb Gnocchi with Parmigiano Reggiano (cheese filled)
- 2 cups fresh spinach
- 1 cup vegetable broth
- 1/2 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup Parmesan
1. **Prepare the Chicken**  
Dice the chicken breast into 1/2-inch cubes. Add the chicken to a bowl and top with Italian seasoning, 2 teaspoons smoked paprika, salt, and pepper. Mix until combined.

2. **Brown the Chicken**  
Place a large, deep skillet over medium heat and add the cooking oil. Once shimmering, add the chicken and cook undisturbed until well browned, about 3 minutes. Stir and brown on the other side for about 3 more minutes. Remove the chicken from the pan when cooked through, leaving the fat in the pan.

3. **Sauté Onion and Garlic**  
Add the onion and garlic to the skillet. Sauté until the onions have softened and the garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes.

4. **Brown the Gnocchi**  
Add the gnocchi and 1 tablespoon salted butter to the skillet. Brown for 2 minutes.

5. **Add Spinach and Broth**  
Add the spinach and vegetable broth to the skillet. Cover the pan and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the spinach has wilted and the gnocchi has hydrated.

6. **Add Cream and Butter**  
Add the heavy cream, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika, and the remaining 1 tablespoon of salted butter to the skillet. Stir until the butter has melted and the cream is steaming hot but not boiling.

7. **Add Parmesan**  
Take the skillet off the heat. Add the Parmesan to the pan and stir until it melts, creating a velvety sauce.

8. **Combine and Serve**  
Return the cooked chicken to the skillet. Mix gently into the gnocchi and cream sauce. If desired, garnish with parsley.
