## Ingredients

- 1 1/2 cups Arborio rice
- 8 oz (225g) cremini or button mushrooms, sliced
- 1 small onion, finely diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 4 cups vegetable broth, kept warm
- 1/2 cup dry white wine (optional, can substitute more broth)
- 3 tablespoons olive oil or unsalted butter, divided
- 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese
- Salt and black pepper, to taste
- 2 tablespoons fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)

## Instructions 

1. **Sauté the Mushrooms**  
   In a large skillet or saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon olive oil or butter over medium heat. Add mushrooms and cook until browned and tender, about 5 minutes. Remove mushrooms and set aside.

2. **Cook the Aromatics**  
   Add another tablespoon of oil or butter to the pan. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook for 1 minute more.

3. **Toast the Rice**  
   Add Arborio rice to the pan and stir to coat. Cook for 1–2 minutes until the edges of the rice are translucent.

4. **Deglaze**  
   Pour in the white wine (if using) and stir until mostly absorbed.

5. **Add Broth Gradually**  
   Add warm broth 1/2 cup at a time, stirring frequently and letting the rice absorb most of the liquid before adding more. Continue until the rice is creamy and al dente, about 18–22 minutes.

6. **Finish the Risotto**  
   Stir in the cooked mushrooms, remaining tablespoon of oil or butter, and parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

7. **Serve**  
   Garnish with fresh parsley and extra parmesan if desired. Serve hot.
