## Instructions 
1. **Cook the mushrooms**  
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add mushrooms and 1/4 teaspoon salt; increase heat to medium-high and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have released their liquid and turned golden, 8-10 minutes. Transfer to a bowl; cover and set aside.

2. **Prepare the cauliflower rice**  
Pulse cauliflower in a food processor until it breaks down into rice-size pieces. You should have about 5 1/2 cups.

3. **Sauté the shallot**  
Wipe out the pan. Add the remaining 1 tablespoon oil and reduce heat to medium. Add shallot and cook, stirring often, until tender, about 2 minutes.

4. **Add garlic**  
Add garlic; stir often until fragrant, about 1 minute.

5. **Cook the cauliflower rice**  
Add the cauliflower "rice", thyme, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring for 2 minutes.

6. **Add wine and broth**  
Add wine; cook, stirring until the wine evaporates, 1 to 2 minutes. Add broth and cook for 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until the "rice" is very tender, 4 to 5 minutes.

7. **Add butter**  
Uncover, increase heat to medium, and add butter. Cook, stirring until the butter has melted, about 1 minute longer.

8. **Finish and serve**  
Stir in parmesan, the reserved mushrooms, parsley, and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper.
