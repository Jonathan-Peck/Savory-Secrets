## Ingredients
- Kosher salt
- 1 lb. mezze rigatoni 
- 3 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, divided, plus more for drizzling
- 1 lb. sweet Italian sausage
- 1 lb. broccoli florets, cut into bite-size pieces
- 1 medium shallot, finely chopped
- 8 cloves garlic, finely chopped
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1 Tbsp. chopped fresh tarragon (optional)
- 1 Tbsp. finely grated lemon zest 
- 1 Tbsp. finely sliced fresh basil
- 3 oz. Pecorino Romano, finely grated (about 1 1/2 c.) 
- 8 oz. burrata, torn into thirds 
- Freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions 
1. **Cook the Pasta**  
In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook pasta, stirring occasionally, until very al dente, 6 to 8 minutes (it won’t be fully cooked through). Reserve about 2 cups pasta water.

2. **Brown the Sausage**  
Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Cook sausage, breaking into large chunks, until golden brown and crispy, 8 to 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate.

3. **Sauté the Broccoli**  
In same skillet over medium heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add broccoli; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Cook, mostly undisturbed and reducing heat to medium-low if pan gets too hot, until one side is caramelized and florets are tender with a little crunch, 6 to 8 minutes. Transfer to plate with sausage.

4. **Make the Sauce and Combine**  
In same skillet over medium-low heat, heat 1 tablespoon oil. Add shallot and garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until shallot is translucent and garlic is fragrant, about 5 minutes. Add cream, tarragon (if using), lemon zest, basil, pasta, and 1 cup pasta water; season with 1 teaspoon salt. Increase heat to medium, bring to a simmer, and cook, tossing and adding more pasta water if needed, until pasta is al dente, 5 to 6 minutes more.

5. **Finish and Serve**  
Remove from heat and stir in Pecorino Romano, sausage, and broccoli. Top with burrata. Drizzle with oil; season with pepper.
