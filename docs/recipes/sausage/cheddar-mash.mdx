## Instructions 
1. Place the potatoes in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add the broth and enough water to cover the potatoes by about 1-inch. 
Place over HIGH heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until very tender all the way 
through when pierced with a fork or the tip of a sharp knife. It’s important that they are tender enough or they will not be smooth.
2. Meanwhile, allow the sour cream to rest at room temperature while the potatoes simmer.
3. Warm the milk in a saucepan over LOW heat or in the microwave, just until warm. Set it aside.
4. Drain the potatoes well, return them to the warm, empty pot and set it over LOW heat. Heat, tossing the potatoes, for a minute or two to 
evaporate any remaining moisture and let the potatoes dry a bit. Remove the pot from the heat.
5. cook the sausage in a skillet over medium heat until browned and cooked through, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.

  <TabItem value="Hand Mashing Instructions" label="Hand Mashing Instructions">Add the butter and use a potato masher to break up the potatoes a little. Add the sour cream and salt and mash again. Add about half the milk and continue to mash to the desired consistency, adding as much of the remaining milk as desired. You can mash them until super creamy or leave them with a little texture. Use a spoon to stir in the cheese, until melted and well combined.</TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Elecrtic Mixer Instructions" label="Electric Mixer Instructions">Use an electric mixer on LOW speed to break up the potatoes a little then add the butter, sour cream, and the salt. Beat again on MEDIUM speed, adding the warmed milk as you mix. Add just as much milk as needed to reach the desired consistency and mix just until creamy and smooth. Avoid overworking the potatoes as it can result in a gummy, gluey texture. Use a spoon to stir in the cheese. Taste and add additional salt, if needed.</TabItem>
