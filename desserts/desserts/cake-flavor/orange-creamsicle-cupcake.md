## Ingredients
- 1 cup Butter, room temperature
- 1 1/2 cups Granulated Sugar
- 2 Large Eggs
- 3/4 cup Sour cream
- 2 1/2 cups Cake-Purpose Flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoon Baking Powder
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 3/4 cup Milk
- 1/4 cup Orange Juice
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons orange zest
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

## Instructions 
1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. Prepare cupcake pans by lining them with 24 cupcake paper liners.

3. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar until smooth. Add the egg, extracts, orange zest, milk, orange juice and sour cream. Blend until smooth.

4. Add the dry ingredients to a separate bowl and mix. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and beat slowly until well combined and only a few lumps remain.
