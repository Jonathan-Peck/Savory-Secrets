## Ingredients
- 1 cup Butter, room temperature
- 1 1/2 cups Granulated Sugar
- 2 Large Eggs
- 3/4 cup Sour cream
- 2 1/2 cups Cake-Purpose Flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoon Baking Powder
- 1 teaspoon Salt
- 3/4 cup Milk
- 1/4 cup Orange Juice
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 tablespoons orange zest
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda

## Instructions 
1. **Preheat the Oven**  
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.

2. **Prepare the Cupcake Pans**  
Line 24 cupcake wells with paper liners.

3. **Mix Wet Ingredients**  
In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar until smooth. Add the eggs, vanilla extract, orange zest, milk, orange juice, and sour cream. Blend until smooth.

4. **Combine Dry and Wet Ingredients**  
In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, beating slowly until just combined and only a few lumps remain.

5. **Fill and Bake**  
Fill each lined cupcake cup ¾ full with batter. Bake at 350°F for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. Set aside and allow to cool completely.
