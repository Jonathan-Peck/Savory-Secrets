## Ingredients
- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- ½ teaspoon ground nutmeg
- ½ teaspoon ground ginger
- ½ teaspoon ground cloves
- ½ teaspoon ground allspice
- ½ teaspoon salt
- 1 tablespoon baking powder
- ½ teaspoon baking soda
- ½ cup butter, softened
- 1 cup white sugar
- ⅓ cup brown sugar
- 2 eggs, room temperature
- ¾ cup milk
- 1 cup pumpkin puree

## Instructions 
1. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 24 muffin
cups, or line with paper muffin liners. Sift together the flour, 1
teaspoon cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, clove, allspice, salt, baking
powder, and baking soda; set aside.

2. Beat 1/2 cup of butter, the white sugar, and brown sugar with an
electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should
be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at
a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before
adding the next. Stir in the milk and pumpkin puree after the last egg.
Stir in the flour mixture, mixing until just incorporated. Pour the
batter into the prepared muffin cups.

3. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back
when lightly pressed, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 5
minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.

4. While the cupcakes are cooling, make the frosting by beating the
cream cheese and 1/4 butter with an electric mixer in a bowl until
smooth. Beat in the confectioners' sugar a little at a time until
incorporated. Add the vanilla extract and 1 teaspoon ground
cinnamon; beat until fluffy. Once the cupcakes are cool, frost with the
cream cheese icing.
