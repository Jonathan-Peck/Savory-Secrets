## Ingredients
- 1 1/2 cups heavy cream
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 3 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 small shallot, diced
- 5 medium Yukon Gold or White potatoes
- 1 cup grated Gruyere
- 1/2 cup of grated Parmesan
- 1 teaspoon Thyme

## Instructions 

1. **Preheat Oven**  
Preheat oven to 325 degrees.

2. **Infuse Cream**  
In a small saucepan add cream, salt, and garlic. Bring to a simmer on low heat and cook for 5 minutes. This will allow the garlic to infuse the cream. Remove from heat and set to the side.

3. **Slice Potatoes**  
Thinly slice the potatoes to 1/8" thickness using a mandoline slicer.

4. **Cook Shallots**  
In a 12" cast iron skillet, add butter and shallot and fry on low heat for 5 minutes until the shallots have caramelized.

5. **Arrange Potatoes**  
Arrange the sliced potatoes in a spiral pattern on top of the cooked shallots. Pour the cream mixture over top of the potatoes.

6. **Bake**  
Cover the cast iron skillet tightly with a piece of tin foil. Place the cast iron skillet into the oven and bake for 1 hour and 15 minutes.

7. **Prepare to Broil**  
Remove the pan from the oven and turn temperature to broil.

8. **Add Cheese**  
Cover the potatoes with the grated Gruyere and Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with Thyme. Place cast iron skillet into the oven and broil for 5 minutes until cheese is crispy and bubbling.

9. **Serve**  
Remove from the oven and serve warm.
